Why MIcroservices

Before MIcroservices :- Monolithic architecture
Monolithic architecture is like a big container components of an application are assembled together and tightly packaged
all components of Monolithic program are interconnected and interdependent

disadvantage :-
large and complex application :- becomes difficult to understand and modify
Slow development 
difficult to frequet deployment :- change in one component needs redeployment of complete application
Unscalable :-
Unreliable :- one component fail , entire service go down
Inflexible :- expensive (time & cost) can't adapt to new tech


........................................

In MIcroservice architecture, each service is self-container and implements a single business capability
communication between MIcroservices is stateless communication

Feature:
Small focused :- simplicity, so it can be re-written and maintained without extra efforts
Loosely coupled :- independent of each other , development and deployment quick
Language neutral
Bounded context :- each MIcroservice doesn't need to knoe the implementation of other service 

Advantage :
independent deployment
independent development
fault isolation
Granulary scaling :- scale independently
